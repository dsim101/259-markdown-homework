This project has two raw data files at different scales from a study of infants, children, and adults watching a series of 7 video clips.

I wrote Steps 1 and 2 to import and merge the data, and kept them here for your reference.
Skip down to Step 3 to work on EDA

#SOURCE DESCRIPTION

## FILE 1: auc.csv

Columns:

* stim (stimulus video, levels/labels provided below)
  * id (unique participant identifier)
  * age (in days)
  * AUC_sal (area-under-the-curve for a saliency model)
* AUC_dist (area-under-the-curve for a distance model)

AUC values indicate how well each model predicted where participants looked when watching a video. AUC values can range from 0-1 where .5 is chance and 1 is perfect prediction
